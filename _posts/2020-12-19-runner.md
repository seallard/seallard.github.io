I want to collect and visualise data from my heart rate monitor.
The front end will be written with React and the back end with Node/Express.
Data from the heart rate monitor can be accessed through the [Polar API](https://www.polar.com/accesslink-api/#polar-accesslink-api).


## Building the backend
The back end should expose an API for retrieving the exercise data.
The back end should also subscribe to the Polar API for exercise events and write to them to the database.
Lets start with the latter.


### Consuming the Polar API
Lets create a data service consuming the Polar API:
```javascript

```

### Setting up the database


## Building the front end
