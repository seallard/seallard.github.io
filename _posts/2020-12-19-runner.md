I want to collect and visualise data from my heart rate monitor.
The front end will be written with React and the back end with Node/Express.
The data from my heart rate monitor can be accessed through the [Polar Accesslink API](https://www.polar.com/accesslink-api/#polar-accesslink-api).


## Building the backend
The back end should expose a REST API for retrieving exercise data.
The back end should also poll the Polar Accesslink API and write any resulting data to the database.
Lets start with the latter.
