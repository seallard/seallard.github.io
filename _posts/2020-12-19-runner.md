I want to create a web app which gamifies running. It should collect and visualise exercise data such as heart rate, distance, pace etc. The front end will be written with React and the back end with Node/Express.

I've never done a project in Javascript previously, so there is loads of new things to learn about.
Based on some blog articles [[1](https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure/), [2](https://medium.com/codebase/structure-of-a-nodejs-api-project-cdecb46ef3f8)], I use the following project structure:

```bash
├── backend
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── api
│   │   │   ├── middlewares
│   │   │   └── routes
│   │   ├── models
│   │   ├── services
│   │   └── subscribers
│   └── tests
└── frontend
```
The service layer contains all of the business logic. I will try to use the pub/sub pattern to maintain the single responsibility principle. So, for example, when a user signs up a signup-event will be emitted which all subscribed handlers can deal with (maybe I want to send an email verification, store the user in a table etc.).

## Building the backend
Data from my heart rate monitor can be accessed through the [Polar API](https://www.polar.com/accesslink-api/#polar-accesslink-api). The back end should subscribe to the Polar API for exercise events and write them to a database. The back end should also expose an API for retrieving exercise data.

### Consuming the Polar API
Lets create a service consuming the Polar API with the Axios HTTP client library.

The Polar API uses an authorization protocol called [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) to enable users
to share their Polar data with third-party applications.

```javascript

```
