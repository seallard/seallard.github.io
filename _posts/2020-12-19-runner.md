I want to create a web app which gamifies running. It should collect and visualise exercise data such as heart rate, distance, pace etc. The frontend will be written with React and the backend with Node/Express.

<a href="url"><img src="/assets/img/runner_app.svg"></a>

I've never done a project in Javascript previously, so there is loads of new things to learn.
I'll use the following project structure:

```bash
├── backend
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── api
│   │   │   ├── middlewares
│   │   │   └── routes
│   │   ├── models
│   │   ├── services
└── frontend
```

## Building the backend
Data from my heart rate monitor can be accessed through the [Polar API](https://www.polar.com/accesslink-api/#polar-accesslink-api). The backend should retrieve and store data from the Polar API. The backend should also expose an API for retrieving the data.

### Consuming the Polar API
Lets create a service consuming the Polar API with the Axios HTTP client library.

#### Authorization
The Polar API uses [OAuth2](https://seallard.dev/2020-12-30-oauth/) to enable users to share access to their data. Users authorize the app via a Polar server, giving the app an authorization code which can be swapped for an access token.
#### **`backend/src/services/polar.js`**
```javascript
const getUserAccessToken = (authorizationCode) => {
  const tokenUrl = 'https://polarremote.com/v2/oauth2/token';
  const data = {
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: authorizationCode,
    redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT,
  };
  const config = basicAuthenticationHeaders();
  const request = axios.post(tokenUrl, qs.stringify(data), config);
  return request.then((response) => response.data);
};
```
The issued token is valid for 15 years and is needed to access the data of the user, so it should be stored in a database.

#### Webhooks
Instead of polling the Polar API for each user, it is possible to register a webhook which notifies the app whenever a user completes an exercise session. The webhook can be tested with a tool called ngrok which is used to expose local web servers.
#### **`backend/src/services/polar.js`**
```javascript
const createWebhook = () => {
  const data = {
    'events': [
      'EXERCISE',
    ],
    'url': process.env.WEBHOOK_URL,
  };
  const basicAuth = getEncodedCredentials();
  const config = {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Basic ${basicAuth}`,
    },
  };
  const request = axios.post(baseUrl+'v3/webhooks', data, config);
  return request.then((response) => response.data);
};
```
The app must reply with status code 200 to verify that it is listening. Whenever a registered user completes an exercise session, their user id is posted to the webhook which can be used to retrieve the exercise data.

#### Fetching user data
The Polar API uses a transactional model for fetching user data. So to retrive data, one has to create a transaction, retrieve data with the transaction and then commit it.

#### Setting up the database
I'm using a document database called MongoDB with Mongoose, an object document mapper which makes it easy to save javascript objects to the database. It would make sense to use a relational database in my case (users have exercise sessions with a summary, heart rate data, gps data, distance data etc.), but I want to try using a document database.
The database can be hosted for free using some service, for example [MongoDB ATLAS](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). To specify what the objects to be stored look like, one defines schemas. For example
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  id: {type: Number, required: true},
  accessToken: {type: String, required: true},
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
The schema is used to create a model, which has methods for saving and querying the database.

#### Flow of interaction with Polar
The overall flow will look something like this
1. Users authorize my app to access their data.
2. App receives a post from Polar that a registered user has completed a session.
3. App retrieves the associated exercise data.

The logic is separated from the routes by creating a user service containing two methods; signUp and getExerciseData.
#### **`backend/src/services/user.js`**
```javascript
const signUp = async (authCode) => {
  const token = await polarService.getUserAccessToken(authCode);
  const userId = uuidv4();
  const polarUserId = await polarService.registerUser(userId, token);

  const user = new User({
    id: polarUserId,
    customId: userId,
    accessToken: token,
  });
  await user.save();
};
```
The getExerciseData function is messy since it retrieves and stores all new exercise data for a user. I probably could decouple the data layer more, but who cares? I will not change the underlying database.
#### **`backend/src/services/user.js`**
```javascript
const getExerciseData = async (userId) => {
  const token = await User.find({id: userId})[0].accessToken;
  const transId = await polarService.createTransaction(userId, token);
  const exerciseUrls = await polarService.listExercises(userId, transId, token);

  for (const url of exerciseUrls) {
    const summary = await polarService.getExerciseSummary(url, token);
    storeSummary(summary, userId);

    const sampleUrls = await polarService.listSamples(url, token);

    for (const sampleUrl of sampleUrls) {
      const data = await polarService.getSample(sampleUrl, token);
      storeSample(data, userId);
    };

    if (summary['has-route']) {
      const gpx = await polarService.getGpx(userId, transId, summary.id, token);
      storeGpx(gpx, userId);
    };
  };
  await polarService.commitTransaction(userId, transId, token);
};
```
#### API routes
The app will have the following routes:
* /oauth_callback: retrieves access token and creates user.
* /webhook: handles exercise event from Polar.
* /exercises/id: retrieves list of all exercise ids.
* /exercises/{id}: retrieves

## Building the frontend
Starting out, I just want a plain table of all exercise sessions with the summary data. The next steps are to make each table entry expandable, drawing the route on a map and adding a highscore table (total distance run, max heart rate, highest pace etc.).
