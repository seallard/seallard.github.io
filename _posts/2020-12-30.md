OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol which provides limited access to APIs to third-party apps. For example, a company selling activity-trackers might let customers grant third-party apps access to their activity data using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Why does it exist?
Prior to OAuth, user credentials was shared directly with the third party. This is bad for several reasons. For instance, the third party gains unrestricted access to the protected resource. The only way to revoke access is to change the password, which revokes access for all third-party apps. Another problem in sharing user credentials directly is that if any third party is compromised, all other data protected by the same password is compromised as well.
