OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol which lets users share their information with third-party apps without handing out credentials. For example, a company selling activity-trackers might let customers grant third-party apps access to their activity data using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Why does it exist?
Prior to OAuth, user credentials were shared directly with the third party. This is bad for several reasons. For instance, the third party gains unrestricted access to the protected resource. The only way for the end-user to revoke access is to change their password, which revokes access for all third-party apps. Another problem in sharing user credentials directly is that if any third party is compromised, all other data protected by the same password is compromised as well. OAuth solves these problems by issuing separate credentials for the third-party apps which are limited in scope and duration.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
| :------ |:--- |
| Resource owner | Entity capable of granting access to a protected resource, often an end-user. |
| Resource server | The server hosting the protected resource. |
| Client | The third-party app which wants to access the resource of the resource owner. |
| Authorization server | Issues access tokens to the client. |
| Access token | Used to access the protected resource. |

## How does it work?

1. The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
2. The client receives an authorization grant.
3. The client requests an access token using the authorization grant.
4. The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the authorization grant and issues an access token.
5. The client requests the protected resource using the access token.
6. The resource server validates the access token and serves the request.

## How is it used?
If you are a client, you have to register your app with the service to receive a client id and secret.
Users authorize your app by following an URL of the following format
```
https://auth-server.com/auth?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=scope
```
where ```CLIENT_ID``` is your client id, ```REDIRECT_URI``` is the URI to which the user is returned after
authorization and ```scope``` is the scope of the resources you want to access (```photos``` for example).
The redirect URI is set when you register your app to the service, something like ```https://example-app.com/oauth_callback```.

After granting authorization, the user is redirected back to your app with an authorization code as a parameter.
Your app exchanges this code for an access token by posting to the authorization servers token endpoint:

```
POST https://api.auth-server.com/token
  grant_type=authorization_code&
  code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
  redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
  client_id=CLIENT_ID&
  client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
```
